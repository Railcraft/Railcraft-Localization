### Submitting and editing a language file
If you intend to sumbit or edit a langauge file, please be aware that the file must be in UTF-8 encoding without Byte-Order-Marks(BOM).

If you do not know what any of that means, please do some research before submitting a language file.

Notepad++ is the recommend text editor for editing language files because it is capable of saving files in the correct format via the Encoding menu.

Other editors may not save files in the correct format (Notepad, Wordpad, etc...do not).
